ChatGPT
PROMPT 1
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚Äú[My Code] Can you implement the Bootstrap grid system to the code? But leave everything else as it is.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚ÄúPerfecto üôå. Para que tu p√°gina quede igual a como la tienes ahora pero organizada dentro de un grid de Bootstrap, lo que hacemos es envolver cada bloque principal dentro de un .container ‚Üí .row ‚Üí .col. As√≠ no cambia el contenido, solo la estructura y alineaci√≥n. Te dejo el c√≥digo reacomodado:‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	Edits: The code was the same, but now with a grid system implemented. AI left the part from the table empty, and I had to add the row.
Reflection: Since I had to research the Bootstrap grid system in the last project delivery, I already knew how the system works and what the classes mean. That‚Äôs why I asked ChatGPT to implement it to the code, because it allowed me to be more efficient and focus my attention on learning how to implement the other elements that are asked for in the exercise.
PROMPT 2
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúShould the Bootstrap Accordion be divided by rows like the grid system?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚ÄúEl accordion de Bootstrap no requiere que lo pongas dentro de rows. Solo necesita su contenedor con la clase accordion y cada √≠tem con accordion-item. Solo deber√≠as usar rows y cols si quieres acomodar varios accordions en la grilla de Bootstrap.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	Edits: I implemented an Accordion in the Hobbies section from the Home page and, since there was only text in that section, when I implemented the grid system, it was organized by columns and rows. So, I had to erase them and adapt the code from the Bootstrap website to what I needed.
Reflection: I didn‚Äôt know that everything in bootstrap was not organized in the grid system. I thought that the grid system was like a general part of Bootstrap, but now I understand that it is not. It is like another element, but its an structure, not an element.
PROMPT 3
‚Ä¢	Prompt: Why doesn‚Äôt my nav bar display the menu?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚Äú¬°Ah! Ya veo cu√°l es el problema. Est√°s usando Bootstrap 5, pero tu c√≥digo del navbar tiene atributos de Bootstrap 4 (data-toggle, data-target) en lugar de los correctos para Bootstrap 5 (data-bs-toggle, data-bs-target). En Bootstrap 5, los atributos cambiaron para usar el prefijo data-bs-.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	Edits: The references that I had in the head of the html code were from Bootstrap 5, but the part of the nav bar was Bootstrap 4. In the link where I was viewing the bootstrap examples, Bootstrap 4 was being explained. I changed my search on Google from ‚ÄúNav Bar Bootstrap‚Äù to ‚ÄúNav Bar Bootstrap 5‚Äù, implemented the correct version and adapted it to the code.
Reflection: I didn‚Äôt imagine that the versions could affect the implementation so much. Now, I always search for the examples on Google as ‚Äú[element I want] Bootstrap 5‚Äù.
What I Learned
‚Ä¢	The accordion doesn‚Äôt have to be divided by rows and columns.
‚Ä¢	If you duplicate scripts, the elements behave strangely.
‚Ä¢	You must be careful when duplicating parts of the code.
‚Ä¢	There are different versions of Bootstrap.
Challenges & Bugs
‚Ä¢	Problem: I had to be very careful when modifying the code from the official website because there were divs that I had to maintain or erase and if I left extra divs, the code could stop working.
‚Ä¢	 Solution: I was looking at what my code was before and to the bootstrap code at the same time, so that I could modify it line by line and be very careful. That allowed me to understand better the implementation of the Accordion.
‚Ä¢	Problem: My Accordion element suddenly stopped working as it should. I couldn‚Äôt collapse my headings. 
‚Ä¢	Solution: When implementing the Tooltips I was having problems (I didn't have time to solve it during this session) and thought that the solution was to add the Js script from bootstrap, although I already had one. Duplicate scripts caused the accordion to behave strangely.
‚Ä¢	Problem: There were two headings that were collapsing at the same time.
‚Ä¢	Solution: The bootstrap example had three items in the accordion, and I needed four, so I duplicated the lines from one item. Since it was duplicated, although the content was different, the ids were the same, so the classes were doing the same thing for both items. I only had to make a unique id for each item.

‚Ä¢	Bootstrap website
Next Steps
‚Ä¢	Add more of the elements from Bootstrap to my personal website.
‚Ä¢	Be more careful when editing.
Personal Reflection 
I should be more careful when adapting the examples to my code because little details like the duplications of ids can cause problems that seem really complicated, but that can be solved easily. If I pay attention to those things I can use my time on developing instead of debugging. In general, those kinds of mistakes are the ones that I make so it will be perfect if I focus on solving them. Also, when I changed the code from the personal website, I realized that the bootstrap elements and grid system make the website look better, even without adding anything extraordinary.


Project / Module: JS Exercises
Date: 09/10/2025
Goals for the documented session
‚Ä¢	Finish the JS portfolio.
‚Ä¢	Complete the exercise that sums up at least 8 points to complete the task.
Tasks Completed

‚Ä¢	Images
‚Ä¢	Prime
‚Ä¢	Sieve_erathostenes

ChatGPT
PROMPT 1
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚Äú[Fibbonaci.js code] Can you explain it to me?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚Äú¬°Claro! Vamos a desglosar tu c√≥digo paso a paso y ver qu√© hace y qu√© falta:‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	Edits: In advanced coding class we saw the algorithm for a Fibonacci recursive function and I added it to the code after Chat made me understand it.
Reflection: I understand better the code.
PROMPT 2
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚Äú[Error] What does it mean?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output:  This error means‚Ä¶ To solve it follow the following steps (run and configure node.js in the terminal) ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢	Edits: I made this prompt several times and the errors were related to node.js. I was not running the JavaScript files through node.js or I was not accessing the correct folder, so in the terminal there were shown errors that said that it couldn‚Äôt find the file.
Reflection: Most of the errors that I get are related to running the code because of mistakes in syntax or in running the code. They also have an easy solution or a simple error, but I usually can‚Äôt identify them by myself. I mean, I know what could be the problem, but I don‚Äôt know where is exactly ubicated.
PROMPT 3
‚Ä¢	Prompt: [ErrorReference: document is not defined at‚Ä¶] What doesn‚Äôt it work?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚Äú¬°Este error ocurre porque est√°s intentando ejecutar c√≥digo que usa document.getElementById con Node.js.!‚Äù Si quieres probar el Fibonacci solo en la terminal, elimina la parte de document y pasa el n√∫mero como argumento.
‚Ä¢	Edits: I was using document.getElementById and console.log at the same time. I erased the document.getElementbyId and tested the function Fibonacci with console.log, then I connected it to the html file.
Reflection: I wasn't sure how node and js interact with each other, but now I know that js is related to the DOM and node is related to the server.
PROMPT 4
‚Ä¢	Prompt: [Code] este es mi archivo html, pero el navegador no hace nada
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚Äú¬°El problema es que tu bot√≥n no tiene un evento asociado!
‚Ä¢	Edits: I added the eventlistener function.
‚Ä¢	Reflection: I wasn‚Äôt so familiar to the functions and syntaxis that follows JS to interact with other languages or parts of the server. Now I understand that the event listener ‚Äúlistens‚Äù when the user clicks on an specific button.
PROMPT 5
‚Ä¢	Prompt: var resultado = fibonacci(); como sabe qu√© numero es?
‚Ä¢	Output: chat explained the flow of the code to me.
‚Ä¢	Reflection: Since there were functions called before its declaration I got lost on the flow, but I could understand at the end thanks to Chat.
What I Learned
‚Ä¢	JS is for modifying the DOM and node.js to create the environment.
‚Ä¢	Window onload function is to be sure that the DOM is loaded before looking for the elements.
‚Ä¢	The JS looks for the elements from the DOM by ID with document.getElementbyId function.
‚Ä¢	.textContent changes the text from the specified element.
‚Ä¢	parseInt() converts the value input to an integer so that it can be managed correctly into the function.
‚Ä¢	Use script is for avoiding errors in a function. JavaScript starts to prohibit some things like declaring empty variables and send error messages.

Project / Module: ExpressEJS Portfolio
Date:15/10/2025
Goals for the documented session
‚Ä¢	Finish the ExpressEJS exercise.
Tasks Completed
‚Ä¢	Implement the following elements: Navbar and/or tabs, Accordion, Buttons, Tooltips.
‚Ä¢	Modify the structure.
Use of Gen AI
ChatGPT
PROMPT 1
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚Äú<input type="checkbox" name="opcion1" value="valor1"> POST METHOD <form action="/login" method="<%= true ? 'POST' : 'GET' %>"> change the condition so that if the checkbox is activated, send it with post‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚ÄúGood question ‚Äî you can‚Äôt directly make a form‚Äôs method change dynamically based on a checkbox purely with HTML. You‚Äôll need a little bit of JavaScript to do that.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúThe forms is sent, the client hears the submission and change the method according to the checkbox, then it sends it to the server and the server receives it?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: ‚Äú So yes, the client ‚Äúhears‚Äù the submission, updates the method dynamically, and then the server receives it correctly.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Edits: I erased the ejs file and the ejs label. In the server instead of rendering the ejs file, with a get method I sent the html file and added the script tag to it.
Reflection: I learned that I cannot change something directly with ejs based on a checkbox.
PROMPT 2
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúHow do I send to a ejs file?
‚Ä¢	Output: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up EJS in Express
‚Ä¢	Before rendering, you need to tell Express that you‚Äôre using EJS: 
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
Express will look for EJS files inside a views folder by default.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Render a template
When a client requests a route (like /login), you can render an EJS file:
app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
    const userName = "Andrea"; // for example
    res.render('test', { userName }); 
});

‚Ä¢	Edits: I implemented that part of the code to my server.js and adapted it.
Reflection: I just needed to remember the syntax. That is something I am struggling with lately.
PROMPT 3
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúHOW CAN I SEND MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: Passing multiple variables
res.render('test', { 
  userName: "Andrea", 
  age: 25, 
  city: "Mexico City" 
});
userName, age, and city are all now available in test.ejs.
‚Ä¢	Edits: I added one variable to the res.render function in my server.js
‚Ä¢	Reflection: I thought it would be more complicated. I thought that maybe I had to convert into a json file or something like that. 
PROMPT 4
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúCan a button send a get?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inside a form, 2Ô∏è‚É£ As a link styled like a button, 3Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript approach.
‚Ä¢	Edits: I chose the JavaScript approach because it was the easiest way to do it.
‚Ä¢	Reflection: There are many ways to achieve something, and it is just a matter of choosing which one is best.
PROMPT 4
‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚Äú[The error I had]‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Output: In header.ejs you have:
<li> <%= name %>!</li>
‚Ä¢	But in your res.render('home', ...) call for home.ejs, you did not pass a variable called name.
‚Ä¢	EJS tries to evaluate <%= name %> and crashes because name is undefined.
________________________________________
How to fix it
You need to make sure every variable used in a template or partial is passed from the server.
‚Ä¢	Prompt: <script> document.getElementById('posts_btn').addEventListener('click', () => { window.location.href = '/home'; }); </script> can I send the name in this lines?
‚Ä¢	Output: Yes ‚Äî you can send the name with a GET request using JavaScript, but you must include it in the URL as a query parameter, because a button click without a form can‚Äôt automatically send data otherwise.
‚Ä¢	Edits: I sent the name through the URL from the event listener that stems from the posts button and then receive it.
‚Ä¢	Reflection: The errors are very clear in the console. It tells you exactly what failed.

What I Learned
‚Ä¢	You cannot change something directly with EJS based on what a checkbox says.
‚Ä¢	You can easily pass variables through the server, html and JS.
‚Ä¢	How to write the code that renders the EJS files in the server.
‚Ä¢	How to send a request and parameter via URL.
‚Ä¢	You cannot use a method directly in a button unless it a submission button from a form.
Challenges & Bugs
‚Ä¢	Problem: I wanted to send a request with a button.
‚Ä¢	 Solution: I used JavaScript to do it so.
‚Ä¢	Problem: The name wasn't reaching the home template.
‚Ä¢	 Solution: I tried to send it through the URL.
‚Ä¢	Problem: But it responded with something empty.
‚Ä¢	Solution: I rendered the actual name from EJS.
